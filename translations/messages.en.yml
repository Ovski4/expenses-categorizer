    Add tags to your transactions whenever you want to group transactions together, but when categorizing does not make sense.
    For example:
    <ul>
      <li>If you want to know how much your vacation cost, create a "<em>Holidays</em>" tags and mark your transactions with it.</li>
      <li>If you want to follow some transactions that should be refunded, create a tag such as "<em>Waiting for refund</em>"</li>
    </ul>
